# Covid19 Risk Assessment App

The goal of this app is to design an app that will be useful for a large number of people for the next few months while we flatten the curve. The app will be available on Google Play and possibly later iOS and have the following features.

1.  Communicate daily risk assessment based on real-time Covid-19 data released and confirmed by WHO
2. Flash across user screen when there is an important WHO update 
3. Communicate official WHO information that is accurate and timely
